DISCLAIMER:
Trading foreign exchange, stocks, commodities, and other financial instruments
on margin carries a high level of risk and may not be suitable for all investors.
The high degree of leverage can work against you as well as for you. Before
deciding to trade, you should carefully consider your investment objectives,
level of experience, and risk appetite. The possibility exists that you could
sustain a loss of some or all of your initial investment and therefore you should
not invest money that you cannot afford to lose. You should be aware of all the
risks associated with trading and seek advice from an independent financial
advisor if you have any doubts.

Past performance is not indicative of future results. This software is provided

investment advice or a recommendation to trade.
