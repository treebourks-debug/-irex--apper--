DISCLAIMER:
Trading foreign exchange, commodities, and other financial instruments on margin
carries a high level of risk and may not be suitable for all investors. The high
degree of leverage can work against you as well as for you. Before deciding to
trade, you should carefully consider your investment objectives, level of
experience, and risk appetite. The possibility exists that you could sustain a
loss of some or all of your initial investment and therefore you should not
invest money that you cannot afford to lose. You should be aware of all the
risks associated with trading and seek advice from an independent financial
advisor if you have any doubts.

Past performance is not indicative of future results. No representation is being
made that any account will or is likely to achieve profits or losses similar to
those discussed in this software or documentation.
